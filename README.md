# CoPL_Interpreter

The implementation of the interpreter is divided over three assignments:

1. A recognizer for the untyped lambda calculus
2. A interpreter for the untyped lambda calculus
3. A type-checker for the **simply typed** lambda calculus

Further updates to this repository will further implement these assignments in this order.
